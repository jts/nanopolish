Quickstart - how to polish a genome assembly
===================================================

The original purpose of nanopolish was to improve the consensus accuracy of an assembly of Oxford Nanopore Technology sequencing reads. Here we provide a step-by-step tutorial to help you get started.

**Requirements**:

* `nanopolish v0.8.4 <installation.html>`_
* `samtools v1.2 <https://htslib.org>`_
* `bwa v0.7.12 <https://github.com/lh3/bwa>`_
* `MUMmer <https://github.com/mummer4/mummer>`_

Download example dataset
------------------------------------

You can download the example dataset we will use here: ::

    wget http://s3.climb.ac.uk/nanopolish_tutorial/ecoli_2kb_region.tar.gz
    tar -xvf ecoli_2kb_region.tar.gz
    cd ecoli_2kb_region

**Details**:

* Sample :	E. coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655
* Instrument : MinION sequencing R9.4 chemistry
* Basecaller : Albacore v2.0.1
* Region: "tig00000001:200000-202000"
* Note: Ligation-mediated PCR amplification performed

This is a subset of reads that aligned to a 2kb region in the E. coli draft assembly. To see how we generated these files please refer to the tutorial :ref:`creati
ng_example_dataset <here>`.

You should find the following files:

* ``reads.fasta`` : subset of basecalled reads
* ``draft.fa`` : draft genome assembly
* ``draft.fa.fai`` : draft genome assembly index
* ``fast5_files/`` : a directory containing FAST5 files
* ``ecoli_2kb_region.log`` : a log file for how the dataset was created with nanopolish helper script (``scripts/extract_reads_aligned_to_region.py``) 

For the evaluation step you will need the reference genome: ::

    wget -O ref.fa ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/archive/old_genbank/Bacteria/Escherichia_coli_K_12_substr__MG1655_uid225/U00096.ffn

Analysis workflow
-------------------------------

The pipeline below describes the recommended analysis workflow for larger datasets. In this tutorial, we will run through the basic steps of the pipeline for this smaller (2kb) dataset.

  :scale: 90%
  :alt: nanopolish-tutorial-workflow

Data preprocessing
------------------------------------

nanopolish needs access to the signal-level data measured by the nanopore sequencer. To begin, we need to create an index ``readdb`` file that links read ids with their signal-level data in the FAST5 files: ::

    nanopolish index -d fast5_files/ reads.fasta

We get the following files: ``reads.fasta.index``, ``reads.fasta.index.fai``, ``reads.fasta.index.gzi``, and ``reads.fasta.index.readdb``.

Compute the draft genome assembly using canu
-----------------------------------------------

As computing the draft genome assembly takes a few hours we have included the pre-assembled data for you (``draft.fa``).
We used the following parameters with `canu <canu.readthedocs.io>`_: ::

    canu \
        -p ecoli -d outdir genomeSize=4.6m \
        -nanopore-raw albacore-2.0.1-merged.fastq \

Compute a new consensus sequence for a draft assembly
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now that we have ``reads.fasta`` indexed with ``nanopolish index``, and have a draft genome assembly ``draft.fa``, we can begin to improve the assembly with nanopolish. Let us get started! 

First step, is to index the draft genome assembly. We can do that with the following command: ::

    bwa index draft.fa

Next, we align the original reads (``reads.fasta``) to the draft assembly (``draft.fa``) and sort alignments: ::

    bwa mem -x ont2d -t 8 draft.fa reads.fasta | samtools sort -o reads.sorted.bam -T reads.tmp
    samtools index reads.sorted.bam

**Checkpoint**: we can do a quick check to see if this step worked. The bam file should not be empty. ::

    samtools view reads.sorted.bam | head

Then we run the consensus algorithm. For larger datasets we use ``nanopolish_makerange.py`` to split the draft genome assembly into 50kb segments, so that we can run the consensus algorithm on each segment in parallel. The output would be the polished segments in ``fasta`` format. 
Since our dataset is only covering a 2kb region, we skip this step and use the following command: ::

    nanopolish variants --consensus polished.fa \
        -w "tig00000001:200000-202000" \
        -r reads.fasta \
        -b reads.sorted.bam \
        -g draft.fa

We are left with our desired output: ``polished.fa``.

Evaluate the assembly
---------------------------------

To analyze how nanopolish performed improving the accuracy we use `MUMmer <https://github.com/mummer4/mummer>`_. MUMmer contains "dnadiff", a program that enables us to see a report on alignment statistics. With dnadiff we can compare the two different assemblies. ::

    mkdir analysis
    MUMmer3.23/dnadiff --prefix analysis/draft.dnadiff ref.fa draft.fa
    MUMmer3.23/dnadiff --prefix analysis/polished.dnadiff ref.fa polished.fa

This generates ``draft.dnadiff.report`` and ``polished.dnadiff.report`` along with other files. The metric we are interested in is ``AvgIdentity`` under ``[ Alignments ] 1-to-1``, which is a measurement of how similar the genome assemblies are to the reference genome. We expect to see a higher value for the polished assembly than the draft ( ``99.90`` vs ``99.53`` ), concluding that the nanopolish consensus algorithm worked successfully.

.. note:: The example dataset was PCR amplified causing a loss of methylation information. We recommend using the ``-q dam,dcm`` with ``nanopolish variants --consensus`` if you have data with methylation information to account for known bacterial methyltransferases.
